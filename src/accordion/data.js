        "question": "What is the difference between a process and a thread?",
        "answer": "A process is an independent program in execution with its own memory space, while a thread is a smaller unit of execution within a process that shares memory with other threads in the same process."
    },
    {
        "id": 2,
        "question": "Explain the concept of object-oriented programming (OOP).",
        "answer": "Object-oriented programming is a paradigm based on the concept of objects, which contain data in the form of fields and methods. Key principles include encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction."
    },
    {
        "id": 3,
        "question": "What are the main differences between SQL and NoSQL databases?",
        "answer": "SQL databases are relational, structured, and use tables with predefined schemas, while NoSQL databases are non-relational, flexible in schema, and store data in formats like documents, key-value pairs, or graphs."
    },
    {
        "id": 4,
        "question": "What is the purpose of design patterns in software development?",
        "answer": "Design patterns provide reusable solutions to common problems in software design, promoting code readability, maintainability, and scalability."
    },
    {
        "id": 5,
        "question": "How does version control work, and why is it important?",
        "answer": "Version control tracks changes to code over time, enabling collaboration, rollback to previous versions, and maintaining a history of modifications. Itâ€™s crucial for teamwork and efficient project management."
    },
    {
        "id": 6,
        "question": "What is the difference between REST and GraphQL?",
        "answer": "REST is an architectural style that uses fixed endpoints for resources, while GraphQL is a query language that allows clients to request specific data, reducing over-fetching and under-fetching."
    },
    {
        "id": 7,
        "question": "What is a microservices architecture?",
        "answer": "Microservices architecture is an approach where applications are built as a collection of small, independently deployable services that communicate over a network, improving scalability and maintainability."
    },
    {
        "id": 8,
        "question": "Explain the concept of continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD).",
        "answer": "CI/CD is a practice in DevOps where code changes are automatically tested, integrated, and deployed to production, ensuring faster and more reliable software delivery."
    },
    {
        "id": 9,
        "question": "What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous programming?",
        "answer": "Synchronous programming executes tasks sequentially, blocking subsequent tasks until the current one finishes, while asynchronous programming allows tasks to run concurrently, improving efficiency for I/O-bound operations."
    },
    {
        "id": 10,
        "question": "How do you ensure the scalability of an application?",
        "answer": "To ensure scalability, I design applications with modularity, use load balancers, optimize database queries, implement caching, and consider cloud-based solutions for dynamic resource allocation."
